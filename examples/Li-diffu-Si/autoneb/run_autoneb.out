Notice: AutoNEB method is set
You manually set n_simul = 3, n_max = 8
----- Running AutoNEB -----
----- improvedtangent method is being used -----
The NEB initially has 3 images  (including the end-points)
Now adding images for initial run
Max length between images is at  0
Now adding images for initial run
Max length between images is at  2
Start of evaluation of the initial images
Now starting iteration 1 on  [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
Finished initialisation phase.
****Now adding another image until n_max is reached (5/8)****
Adding image between 0 and 1. New image point is selected on the basis of the biggest spring length!
Now starting iteration 2 on  [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
****Now adding another image until n_max is reached (6/8)****
Adding image between 4 and 5. New image point is selected on the basis of the biggest spring length!
Now starting iteration 3 on  [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
****Now adding another image until n_max is reached (7/8)****
Adding image between 3 and 4. New image point is selected on the basis of the biggest spring length!
Now starting iteration 4 on  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
n_max images has been reached
****Now doing the CI-NEB calculation****
Now starting iteration 5 on  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
----- AutoNEB calculation finished -----

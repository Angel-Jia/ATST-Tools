===== Running AutoNEB =====
Notice: AutoNEB method is set
You manually set n_simul = 4, n_max = 10
----- Running AutoNEB -----
----- improvedtangent method is being used -----
The NEB initially has 6 images  (including the end-points)
Start of evaluation of the initial images
Now starting iteration 1 on  [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Finished initialisation phase.
****Now adding another image until n_max is reached (6/10)****
Adding image between 1 and 2. New image point is selected on the basis of the biggest spring length!
Now starting iteration 2 on  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
****Now adding another image until n_max is reached (7/10)****
Adding image between 3 and 4. New image point is selected on the basis of the biggest spring length!
Now starting iteration 3 on  [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
****Now adding another image until n_max is reached (8/10)****
Adding image between 6 and 7. New image point is selected on the basis of the biggest spring length!
Now starting iteration 4 on  [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
****Now adding another image until n_max is reached (9/10)****
Adding image between 0 and 1. New image point is selected on the basis of the biggest spring length!
Now starting iteration 5 on  [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
n_max images has been reached
****Now doing the CI-NEB calculation****
Now starting iteration 6 on  [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
----- AutoNEB calculation finished -----
